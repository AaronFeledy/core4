# Lando v4 — Testing, Distribution, and Quality Gates

> **Part 13 of 16** · [Index](./README.md)
> **Read next:** [14 Appendices](./14-appendices.md)

This part defines the quality bar and the release pipeline. Tests run under `bun test`. `tsc --noEmit` is a merge gate. The provider contract suite is mandatory for every `RuntimeProvider` plugin. The default release artifact is the Bun-compiled single-binary, one per platform target, alongside the `@lando/core` library package whose `package.json#bin` entry doubles as the package-manager install path for users who already run Bun.

Covered here: the nine test layers (unit, Effect service, CLI, library API, provider contract, plugin SDK contract, scenario, recipe, end-to-end) with their Effect testing patterns, schema gates (round-trip encode/decode for every public schema), type gates (`tsc --noEmit` + `expectTypeOf` tests in `test/types/`), the PR merge requirements, the scenario / recipe / end-to-end conventions that replace the Lando 3 Leia format, distribution targets and bundled-plugin / bundled-recipe generation, the per-PR/nightly/weekly CI matrices, and the release flow with channels (`stable`, `next`, `dev`) and self-update.

## 13. Testing, Distribution, and Quality Gates

### 13.1 Test layers

| Layer | Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | `bun test` | Pure functions, schemas, expression resolver, merge, planners |
| Effect service | `bun test` + `Effect.TestServices` | Layers with test implementations |
| CLI | `@oclif/test` + `bun test` | Command parsing, flag/arg handling, exit codes |
| Library API | `bun test` + `@lando/core/testing` | Embedding-host surface (§16): `makeLandoRuntime`, public services, `@lando/core/cli` operations, lifecycle event publication |
| Provider contract | Shared contract suite (in `@lando/sdk/test`) | Any `RuntimeProvider` plugin must pass |
| Template engine contract | Shared contract suite (in `@lando/sdk/test`) | Any `TemplateEngine` plugin must pass: capability declaration matches behavior, `lando` engine round-trip parity for the §7.3.1 portable function set, `TemplateRenderContext` shape acceptance without mutation, purity (no shell/FS/network/process state mutation), `unsafe: false` engines reject any helper that performs side effects, render output is byte-stable across repeated calls with identical input |
| Plugin SDK contract | Type tests + runtime tests | Public API compatibility |
| Scenario | `bun test` + `@lando/core/testing` | End-to-end through the library API against `TestRuntimeProvider`; no real container runtime |
| Recipe | `bun test` against `recipes/` | Every canonical recipe scaffolds with default answers and produces a Landofile that passes schema validation; the resulting app starts under the end-to-end suite |
| Deprecation | `bun test` + `@lando/core/testing` | Per-surface tests that exercise every `DeprecationNotice` in the codebase: triggering the surface emits the `deprecation-used` event, the renderer warns once per `(kind, id)`, `lando doctor --deprecations` lists the entry, and the `removeIn` gate rejects stale notices (§18.7–§18.8) |
| Perf budget | `bun test` + `Bun.$` driving `dist/lando-${target}` with byte-resolution stdout/stderr capture | Asserts the §2.1 end-to-end and perceived-performance budgets, the §12.5 hot-path read budgets, and the §8.9.1 first-paint contract |
| End-to-end | `bun test` + `Bun.$` against the compiled binary | The released artifact run on a real OS against a real provider |

**Effect testing patterns:**

- Use `Layer.succeed(Service, mock)` for service mocks; never patch globals.
- Use `Effect.provide` to inject test layers per test.
- Use `TestClock` for time-dependent code.
- Use `TestRandom` for deterministic randomness.
- Use `Stream.fromIterable` to feed test data into stream-based services.

**Provider contract suite** (mandatory for every `RuntimeProvider` plugin):

- Capability reporting matches declared capabilities.
- `apply` is idempotent across repeated calls with the same plan.
- `destroy` removes everything `apply` created.
- `exec` against a missing service returns `ServiceNotFoundError`.
- `logs` produces a `Stream` that completes cleanly when the service stops.
- Mount, endpoint, storage, and route behavior matches the capability matrix.
- Errors are tagged and contain remediation.
- Cancellation propagates: an interrupted `apply` rolls back partial state.

**Template engine contract suite** (mandatory for every `TemplateEngine` plugin and for the built-in `lando` engine):

- The engine's declared `capabilities` (§7.3.2) match observed behavior. An engine with `wholeFile: true` accepts the canonical control-flow grammar; an engine with `partials: true` resolves `{{> name}}`-style partials when the site supplies them.
- The `lando` engine's renders for the §7.3.1 portable function set are byte-stable across repeated calls with identical input.
- A plugin engine that registers the §7.3.1 portable function set produces results that match the `lando` engine's for the same input/context.
- Every engine accepts the canonical `TemplateRenderContext` shape (§7.3.2) without engine-specific mutation; the engine's render output MUST NOT depend on context keys outside the declared shape.
- Purity: a render produces zero observable side effects — no filesystem reads (other than the template itself, already loaded), no network calls, no `process.env` mutation, no `process.cwd()` mutation, no global-state writes. The contract harness asserts this via `Effect.TestServices` with denied filesystem/network access.
- Unsafe engines: an engine with `capabilities.unsafe: true` MUST refuse to render when global config opt-in is absent and emits `TemplateEngineUnsafeRejectedError` (§7.3.2).
- Errors are tagged (`TemplateCompileError`, `TemplateRenderError`) and include the source location and remediation.
- Cancellation: an `Effect.interrupt` during render terminates promptly; finalizers reap any internal resources.

**Library API contract suite** (mandatory; lives in `test/library/`):

- `makeLandoRuntime` returns a Layer satisfying every default service tag in §3.4.
- The default entry (`@lando/core`) does not pull `@oclif/core` into the import graph (import-boundary test).
- `@lando/core/cli` exports a function for every built-in command listed in §16.7's "exported as functions" set.
- `@lando/core/testing` ships a `TestRuntime` that satisfies the provider contract suite against `TestRuntimeProvider`.
- Lifecycle event sequence (§11.4) is identical between a CLI invocation and a programmatic `startApp` call against the same Landofile + plugin set.
- Plugin policy honors `discovery.{bundled,system,user,app}` flags independently, including the library-mode default of all-false.
- Multiple `makeLandoRuntime` instances in one process are isolated (no shared caches, no cross-runtime event leakage).
- A single `LandoRuntime` reused across N sequential operations performs the per-bootstrap work exactly once: bootstrap, plugin discovery, AOT layer instantiation, and cache loading happen on operation 1; operations 2..N each meet their respective §2.1 **hot-path** budget at p95. The library-mode reuse-perf test class lives under `test/perf/library-reuse/` and is part of the perf-budget suite (gated on Linux x64 per §13.4, advisory on macOS/Windows per-PR CI). The test class asserts the §16.3 "Runtime reuse for performance" contract for `runTooling`, `appInfo`, `appConfig.get`, and a representative `appStart` → `appStop` round-trip.
- Closing the host scope finalizes every runtime resource (provider connections, file watchers, log streams).
- Tagged errors crossing the runtime boundary include their full payload schema and remediation field.
- `runTooling(name, input)` executes the same compiled task graph through CLI and library paths, including deps, expressions, status/precondition behavior, and lifecycle events.

**Scenario suite** (lives in `test/scenarios/`):

- One TypeScript file per scenario; uses `bun test` with `@lando/core/testing`.
- Drives the program through the public library API (`makeLandoRuntime`, `runTooling`, `startApp`, programmatic `@lando/core/cli` operations).
- Backed by `TestRuntimeProvider` — no Docker, no Podman, no real network, no host filesystem mutation outside `os.tmpdir()`.
- Asserts on plan output, lifecycle event sequence (§11.4), expression resolution, error tagging and remediation, and `Scope` cleanup.
- Fixtures (Landofiles, source trees, plugin manifests) live in `test/scenarios/fixtures/<name>/` and are shared across scenarios.
- Cleanup is automatic via Effect `Scope` finalizers; tests do not call `lando destroy` and do not leave state on disk.
- Runs on every PR on every supported platform in the per-PR matrix (§13.6) and is expected to complete in seconds, not minutes.

**Recipe suite** (lives in `test/recipes/`):

- One TypeScript file per canonical recipe under `recipes/<id>/` plus a shared driver.
- For each recipe, the suite scaffolds with default answers into `os.tmpdir()`, asserts that `recipe.yml` validates against the published `RecipeManifest` schema, asserts that every prompt's `default` resolves, asserts that every file under `files:` renders without expression errors, and asserts that the produced `.lando.yml` validates against the published Landofile schema (§7.8).
- An additional pass exercises non-default branches: each `select` / `multiselect` / `confirm` is varied across its choice space (subject to a coverage cap) and the produced Landofile is re-validated.
- The suite does NOT start the resulting app; that is the end-to-end suite's responsibility. The recipe suite establishes that scaffolding is structurally correct and fast.
- Runs on every PR on every supported platform.

**Perf-budget suite** (lives in `test/perf/`):

- One TypeScript file per command class (level-`none`, `minimal`, `tooling` hot path, `app` cold start). Driven by `Bun.$` against the compiled binary at `dist/lando-${target}` (the artifact §13.5 produces).
- Each test runs the command 50× and asserts on p95 timing against the §2.1 end-to-end budget plus the §2.1 perceived-performance budget. Both are merge gates per §13.4.
- The suite measures three timings per invocation: process spawn → first byte to stdout/stderr (first-paint), process spawn → final byte (end-to-end), and (for tooling fast path) the §12.5 hot-path read budget extracted from the `meta:events:follow` trace.
- The cold variant drops OS file caches before each run on Linux (`sync && echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches`); macOS and Windows runners use platform equivalents where available, otherwise the cold variant is skipped on those runners with a CI annotation. The warm variant runs back-to-back without cache drops.
- The level-`none` test class additionally asserts that the binary's level-`none` invocations do not import `@oclif/core` or any module that constructs a `Context.Service`, by snapshotting `Bun.embeddedFiles` access patterns through a debug build flag (`LANDO_PERF_TRACE=1`) — the trace is asserted against an allowlist.
- The first-paint test class drives `lando start` against `TestRuntimeProvider` in a way that lets the test inject artificial latency at provider `apply` and asserts that the §8.9.1 banner, spinner, and skeleton-table rules fire within their budgets independent of that latency.
- Failures emit a structured report (per-percentile timings, regression delta vs. the channel baseline, top contributors from the embedded `LANDO_PERF_TRACE` log) so a regressing PR has actionable evidence rather than a single "too slow" message.
- The reference runner spec for §17.8 (4 vCPU / 16 GB Linux) is the canonical baseline; budgets are the same on all platforms, but only the Linux runner gates merge by default. macOS/Windows perf runs are advisory on per-PR CI and gating on the nightly matrix.

**End-to-end suite** (lives in `test/e2e/`):

- One TypeScript file per scenario; uses `bun test` with `Bun.$` (or an `Effect`-wrapped equivalent) shelling out to the compiled binary at `dist/lando-${target}` produced by §13.5.
- Each test acquires its own working directory under `os.tmpdir()`. Fixture sources are split by purpose:
  - Internal-only fixtures (edge cases, regressions, contrived names) live under `test/e2e/fixtures/<name>/`.
  - Recipe-driven scenarios scaffold from `recipes/<id>/` via `lando init --recipe <id> --no-interactive --answers …` so the e2e suite exercises the same scaffolding path users hit. The scaffolded directory is the test fixture; the recipe directory is never mutated.
- Each test registers an Effect `Scope` finalizer that runs `lando destroy -y`, `lando poweroff` (where appropriate), and `rm -rf` regardless of success, failure, timeout, or interrupt.
- Assertions are structured: parsed JSON output, full stdout/stderr captured into the failure message, exit codes, file system state, real network endpoints, and event traces consumed via `lando events --follow --format json`.
- The compiled-binary smoke suite includes external plugin-loader coverage: load an external ESM plugin by absolute `file://` URL, load an external TypeScript plugin, resolve plugin-local dependencies, reject module paths escaping the plugin root, and continue after an unrelated plugin load failure.
- Runs against a real provider — the Lando-managed runtime by default; the weekly provider matrix substitutes Docker Desktop, Docker Engine, Podman Desktop, Podman, Lima, and OrbStack.
- Includes an offline-after-build scenario: build/start an app with any Lando-managed remote dependencies while online, disable network access for Lando-controlled fetches, then verify `lando start`, `info`, `logs`, `stop`, `restart`, and a cached tooling command do not require network. App-level dependency commands are excluded unless the scenario intentionally asserts their behavior.
- Tests must tolerate first-run runtime download (`lando setup`); the cost is reported in the test setup phase and excluded from per-test timeouts.
- The Lando 3 `examples/` directory is **not** the home for v4 e2e fixtures. Internal regressions live under `test/e2e/fixtures/`; user-facing scenarios live as canonical recipes under `recipes/<id>/` and are tested through the scaffold flow. The `examples/` directory does not exist in the v4 layout. Doc snippets that appear on the user-facing docs site are extracted from or kept in sync with the recipe templates via a generator that fails CI when the source and the docs diverge.
- A smoke subset (tagged `@smoke`) runs on every PR on Linux x64 against the Lando-managed runtime; the full suite runs nightly on Linux x64/arm64 and macOS x64/arm64; Windows e2e runs on the weekly provider matrix.
- The e2e suite is the explicit replacement for the Lando 3 Leia (`@lando/leia`) approach. The "Markdown as executable spec" format is retired: bash-block parsing, `grep`-based assertions, and the `Start up tests` / `Verification commands` / `Destroy tests` heading contract no longer apply. The properties Leia provided — real binary, real provider, structured cleanup — are preserved by this suite using TypeScript assertions and `Scope`-based cleanup; the "fixtures co-located with docs" property is preserved by the recipe scaffolds, which are simultaneously the canonical user-facing init artifacts and the e2e source for stack-starter scenarios.

### 13.2 Schema gates

Core ships and validates schemas for:

- Global config
- Landofile (supported Compose subset + Lando extensions + service config + tooling tasks/includes/defaults + events + proxy)
- Config expressions (AST, function registry metadata, resolution errors, redaction markers)
- Plugin manifest
- Config translator manifests and translation results
- Route, healthcheck, mount, storage, endpoint
- Provider extension declaration metadata
- Event payloads

Schemas are used for runtime validation, JSON Schema generation, doc generation, and contract tests. Every schema has a dedicated `bun test` file that exercises happy path, error path, and round-trip encode/decode.

Public schema gates also verify:

- Every public schema in the registry has an `identifier`, `title`, and `description` annotation.
- Public fields have descriptions unless the field is self-explanatory and documented by an enclosing schema.
- Examples attached to schemas decode successfully.
- JSON Schema generation succeeds for every public schema and produces stable output.
- Generated schema reference docs build without hand edits.

### 13.3 Type gates

`tsc --noEmit` must pass on every PR. Type-only tests live in `test/types/*.test-d.ts` and use `expectTypeOf` patterns to verify inferred types and `Effect` requirement narrowing.

### 13.4 Quality gates

A PR cannot merge unless:

- `bun test` passes.
- `tsc --noEmit` passes.
- `bunx biome check` passes (lint + format).
- The provider contract suite passes against the bundled providers.
- The library API contract suite passes.
- The scenario suite passes on every per-PR platform.
- The recipe suite passes on every per-PR platform; every canonical recipe under `recipes/` validates and produces a schema-valid Landofile with default answers.
- The end-to-end smoke subset passes on Linux x64.
- The deprecation suite passes: every `DeprecationNotice` in the codebase has a corresponding test that exercises the surface and asserts the `deprecation-used` event payload (§18.4); the renderer's per-`(kind, id)` dedup is verified across loops; `--no-deprecation-warnings` and `LANDO_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS=0` suppress renderer output without affecting recording, the event, or `lando doctor` (§18.6).
- The deprecation lint gate passes: `bun run lint:deprecations` (§18.8) walks the AST and asserts every TS export carrying a TSDoc `@deprecated` tag is wrapped with `markDeprecated(notice, impl)`; mismatches fail the build.
- The deprecation removal gate passes: `scripts/check-deprecations.ts` (§18.7) loads every notice, fails with `DeprecationStaleError` when a notice's `removeIn` matches the version being released and the surface is still present, and fails with `DeprecationOverdueError` when a notice's `removeIn` is in the past. The check also runs as part of `bun run codegen:check`.
- The perf-budget suite passes on Linux x64: every command class meets its §2.1 end-to-end budget at p95, every command at level ≥ `plugins` meets the §2.1 perceived-performance first-paint budgets, and the §12.5 hot-path read budgets hold. macOS and Windows perf runs are advisory on per-PR CI but block release on the nightly matrix.
- Level-`none` commands (§3.2) do not import `@oclif/core` or construct any `Context.Service`, verified by the `LANDO_PERF_TRACE` allowlist snapshot in the perf-budget suite.
- Top-level module work in any module reachable from `bin/lando.ts` stays under the §2.4 budget; this is asserted as part of the level-`none` perf test class.
- New CLI-surface or library-surface behavior has at least one test in `test/scenarios/`; new CLI-surface behavior additionally has at least one test in `test/e2e/` (smoke-tagged when fast enough, full-suite otherwise).
- New canonical recipes added to `recipes/` ship with a passing recipe-suite test and an e2e smoke entry.
- New schemas have round-trip tests and required annotations.
- New config translators have detect/translate tests, preview output tests, and write-path tests proving generated fragments validate before they are persisted.
- New app-dependency resolution behavior has an offline-after-build test proving routine local-dev commands use local state and fail clearly when required local state is missing.
- Generated JSON Schema output is up to date.
- Command registry docs, event registry docs, service registry docs, API reports, recipe action docs, and acceptance coverage outputs are up to date.
- Command registry drift checks pass: every built-in command in §8.2 exists in the command registry, every command has canonical namespace metadata, and every recipe post-init allowlisted command declares `recipePostInitAllowed: true`.
- Service registry drift checks pass: every core service tag listed in §3.4 is exported from `@lando/core/services` or explicitly marked internal.
- Event registry drift checks pass: every lifecycle event mentioned in §3.5/§11 has a payload schema or an explicit marker that it is a router-only diagnostic event.
- Deprecation registry drift checks pass: every surface kind in the §18.5 matrix is represented in the merged `DeprecationService` registry walk, every `DeprecationNotice` in the codebase round-trips through schema decode without loss, and every annotated public schema produces a JSON Schema with a valid `x-deprecation` extension.
- The Starlight docs site builds, including generated schema reference pages.
- New abstractions are listed in §4 and have at least one bundled implementation.
- Public API additions to `@lando/core` (any new export from the entry points listed in §16.2) are accompanied by a library-API test under `test/library/` and a JSDoc block on the export.
- Public API additions to `@lando/sdk` are accompanied by a JSDoc/TSDoc block and, when schema-backed, generated schema docs.
- Any change to `package.json#exports` requires an import-boundary test asserting that the default entry stays free of OCLIF.

### 13.5 Distribution

This section catalogs *what* ships. The operational pipeline that produces these artifacts — the ordered build stages, the codegen catalog, asset embedding, signing and notarization, supply-chain attestations, the self-update protocol, and the v4.0.0 install surface — is specified in §17 ([15 Binary Build and Release Engineering](./15-binary-build-and-release.md)). Sections below cite specific §17 subsections where the operational mechanics matter.

Lando v4 ships in two forms, both built from the same source at the same version:

| Form | Audience | Built by | Installed as |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Single-executable CLI binary** | End users; no prerequisites | `bun build --compile` | One per platform: `darwin-x64`, `darwin-arm64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `windows-x64` |
| **Library package** | Bun programs embedding Lando, plus end users who prefer a package-manager install | Standard `@lando/core` publish | `bun add @lando/core` (programmatic) or `bun add -g @lando/core` (CLI on PATH via `package.json#bin`) |

**Single-executable binaries.** The default end-user release artifact is the Bun-compiled binary, one per platform target:

```bash
bun build ./bin/lando.ts --compile --target=bun-${T} --outfile=dist/lando-${T} --minify --sourcemap=external
```

Platforms shipped: `darwin-x64`, `darwin-arm64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `windows-x64`. The compiled binary embeds Bun and has no host prerequisites.

**Library package.** `@lando/core` is published to npm (and any registry the project mirrors to) as a standard ESM package. The package contains the multiple-entry-point structure spec'd in §2.7 (default entry, `/schema`, `/errors`, `/events`, `/services`, `/testing`, `/cli`, `/oclif`). The library and the CLI binary ship at the same version — there is no separate release cadence.

The library package's `package.json#bin` retains the `lando` binary entry, so installing the package globally (`bun add -g @lando/core`) also provides a `lando` CLI on PATH (subject to Bun's bin-link rules). This is the package-manager install path for users who already run Bun and prefer registry-managed installations over a downloaded binary; the runtime behavior is the same as the compiled binary. Hosts that want only the library and don't want a `lando` binary in their `node_modules/.bin` should install with the tooling's no-bin-link option.

`oclif pack` is **not** used to produce a separate tarball release artifact. The library package's bin entry covers the package-manager install path, and the compiled binary covers the no-prerequisites path; an OCLIF-packed tarball would be a redundant third form. `@oclif/core` remains the CLI framework (§2.3); only the `oclif pack` distribution mechanism is dropped.

**Bundled plugins** are statically imported into the compiled binary. The set is defined at build time via `scripts/build-bundled-plugins.ts` which generates `src/plugins/bundled.ts` (§17.2). Removing a plugin from the bundled set is a build-time decision; the user can still install it at runtime. Library consumers do **not** receive bundled plugins by default — they must opt into bundled discovery (§16.4) or contribute their own Layers.

**Bundled recipes** are statically embedded into the compiled binary. The canonical set listed in §8.8.10 is defined at build time via `scripts/build-bundled-recipes.ts` which generates `src/recipes/bundled.ts` (§17.2). Each recipe directory under `recipes/<id>/` is read and its contents (the `recipe.yml`, `templates/`, `fragments/`, `assets/`, and `README.md`) are embedded via the asset-embedding policy in §17.3 as a virtual filesystem available to `lando init --recipe <id>` without disk access. Adding or removing a canonical recipe is a build-time decision; users can still scaffold from any non-canonical recipe by referencing local paths, git, npm, or the registry. Library consumers do **not** receive bundled recipes by default; the same opt-in policy that governs bundled plugins (§16.4) covers bundled recipes.

**Bundled runtime and native helpers.** `@lando/provider-lando` downloads a complete private runtime bundle (Podman binary, helper binaries, configuration) on first use via `lando setup` and installs it under Lando-controlled data paths (§12.4). The bundle is versioned and checksum-verified and does not affect any system-wide Docker or Podman installation. Other provider-specific helpers (e.g., `mkcert`) follow the same on-demand pattern under `<userDataRoot>/bin/`. Core does not bundle any runtime artifacts directly.

**Schemas and types.** The release includes:

- `dist/schemas/*.json` — JSON Schema files for every public schema.
- `dist/types/*.d.ts` — TypeScript declaration bundles, one per entry point in §2.7.
- The `@lando/sdk` package published independently for plugin authors (runtime contract objects plus inferred types; see §2.6).

**Documentation site.** The public documentation site is built from `docs/` with Astro Starlight. It combines authored Markdown/MDX with generated reference pages for schemas, public APIs, CLI commands, lifecycle events, and tagged errors. The docs build consumes the generated schema metadata and fails if the generated reference is stale.

### 13.6 CI matrix

CI runs at three cadences. Each cadence is a superset of the previous one in scope.

**Per-PR CI** — runs on every pull request on:

- macOS x64 + arm64
- Linux x64 + arm64
- Windows x64

Per-PR CI executes: unit, Effect service, CLI, library API, plugin SDK contract, provider contract (against `TestRuntimeProvider` and the bundled provider), scenario, recipe, the perf-budget suite (Linux x64 gating; macOS/Windows advisory), and the `@smoke`-tagged subset of the end-to-end suite (Linux x64 only). Type, schema, lint, and docs-build gates from §13.4 also run on every PR.

**Nightly CI** — runs once per day on Linux x64/arm64 and macOS x64/arm64:

- Full end-to-end suite against the Lando-managed runtime (the default provider).
- Distribution rehearsal: `bun build --compile` for every platform target listed in §13.5, and a dry-run `bun publish --dry-run` of the library package.

**Weekly provider matrix** — runs the provider contract suite **and** the full end-to-end suite against:

- Lando-managed runtime (baseline, all platforms)
- Docker Desktop (latest, macOS + Windows)
- Docker Engine (Linux)
- Podman Desktop (macOS + Windows)
- Podman (Linux)
- Lima (macOS)
- OrbStack (macOS)

### 13.7 Release flow

- **Channels:** `stable`, `next`, `dev`. Plugins may opt into channels independently of core. The channel-to-tag mapping and the GitHub Actions release workflow are specified in §17.8.
- **Versioning:** Strict semver. Core API breaks bump major. Plugin SDK API tracks core major.
- **Auto-update:** `lando update` consults the active channel. The compiled binary self-updates by writing a new binary alongside, atomic-renaming, and re-execing. The update manifest schema, signature verification, Windows running-`.exe` rename strategy, rollback on launch failure, and permission handling are specified in §17.6.
- **Signing & supply chain:** every released artifact is signed (§17.4) and accompanied by a CycloneDX SBOM, a SLSA v1.0 provenance attestation, and cosign signatures (§17.5).
- **Installation:** v4.0.0 ships installable artifacts via GitHub Releases and a curl-pipe installer at `https://get.lando.dev/` (§17.7). Homebrew, scoop, winget, and distro packages are deferred.
- **Plugins update independently** through their own release pipelines. Plugins declare `requires."@lando/core": "^4.0.0"` to opt into compatibility.
